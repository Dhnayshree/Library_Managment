A college library management is a project that manages and stores books information electronically according to students needs. The system helps both students and library manager to keep a constant track of all the books available in the library. It allows both the admin and the student to search for the desired book. It becomes necessary for colleges to keep a continuous check on the books issued and returned and even calculate fine. This task if carried out manually will be tedious and includes chances of mistakes. These errors are avoided by allowing the system to keep track of information such as issue date, last date to return the book and even fine information and thus there is no need to keep manual track of this information which thereby avoids chances of mistakes. Thus this system reduces manual work to a great extent allows smooth flow of library activities by removing chances of errors in the details.

#### **Ageing**
* If the first period was about system building and the second period was about its expansion and the internal renegotiation—among students and schools, and schools and each other—that massification required, the current period is characterized by new external demands that have been placed on the system by several forms of accountability: privacy, equity, and efficiency. 
* Though all of these pressures predate the current period in some form, major shifts in American political dynamics and in the availability of computing power and digital technologies have converged to amplify old concerns and produce new ones.
