# Library Managment System



## **LTTS Genesis project** 
 
## **SDLC ACTIVITY BASED LEARNING**
The main aim of this project is to apply the concept of File Handling to keep record of the student in an computerized way in order to maintain details of student.Students form a major part of any institution that concerns with. There are records that have to be maintained. But the institution finds it difficult to maintain large records of so many students of the organization. Huge heap files will be required. Plus there is no guarantee of such data in huge heap of files. Hence, to prevent these issues, We thought of making a Student Record System to help in quickly accessing and updating the data of students at a single place making it time efficient.The project capabilities include registration process of add, edit, delete, find, update results, list students.

## Challenges faced and How it was Overcome

| Sr. No. | Challenges | Overcome |
|--- |--- |--- |
|1 | Learn  github Workflows and its coordination with visual studio | By Code Inspection |
|2 |Keeping in mind SDLC , we made UML diagram  |  By class,structural,functional diagram |
|2 |Pushing files and folders to repository by Git bash | By removing all the previous pushed files and folders | 
|3 |Making of UML diagrams | By Studing about the basic concepts of making UML diagram |
|4 |Writing all the requirements,cost,swot analysis,4W 1H and High/low level requirements | By studing deep about the project |
|5 | C/C++ CI - Build Status is not passing |  By modifying the code |
