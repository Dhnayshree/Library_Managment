# Library Managment System



## **LTTS Genesis project** 
 
## **Applied STL - CPP INSIGHT**
A college library management is a project that manages and stores books information electronically according to students needs. The system helps both students and library manager to keep a constant track of all the books available in the library. It allows both the admin and the student to search for the desired book. It becomes necessary for colleges to keep a continuous check on the books issued and returned and even calculate fine. This task if carried out manually will be tedious and includes chances of mistakes. These errors are avoided by allowing the system to keep track of information such as issue date, last date to return the book and even fine information and thus there is no need to keep manual track of this information which thereby avoids chances of mistakes.
Thus this system reduces manual work to a great extent allows smooth flow of library activities by removing chances of errors in the details.


**Modules:**

* Students Details- We can  add or update the student details such as name, roll number, etc. These details will be stored in different variables.

* Add/Remove/Update Books- This library management system project will be programmed to add, remove, or update books easily that will make it more efficient.

* Complete Books Details- This C++ program will include all the complete details of books present in the store. 

* Authentication- You can easily login to the LMS service with different roles. If you are an admin then you will get the admin id and password from which you can easily access the admin services and the same for all the users.

* Database- All the information added or removed will be updated in the database. If you are an admin then you can access and edit the database
