# **LIBRARY Management System**

## Introduction 
The main aim  of this project is to apply the concept of  **File Handling** to keep record   in an computerized way in order to maintain records.Students from different branch can issue the book and the system helps both students and library manager to keep a constant track of all the books available in the library. There are records that have to be maintained in a big insttution. But the institution finds it difficult to maintain large records of so many books. Huge heap files will be required. Plus there is no guarantee of such data in huge heap of files.This task if carried out manually will be tedious and includes chances of mistakes. These errors are avoided by allowing the system to keep track of information such as issue date, last date to return the book and even fine information and thus there is no need to keep manual track of this information which thereby avoids chances of mistakes.
Hence, to prevent these issues, We thought of making a Library-management  System to help in quickly accessing and updating the data of books at a single place making it time efficient.The project capabilities include admin and user login, add and update books ,Search option , view orders and placed order.
